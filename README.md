# Complete CI CD Implementation

- This is a huge project in which I have put all my learning of several DevOps tools like - Jenkins, - Maven - Sonarqube - Trivy Image Scanner - Nexus Repository - Docker - Kubernetes
  along with some project management tool like - Jira for Ticketing and Managing project

- This is the first version of the project, in the second version, we are going to define the infrastructure using `Terraform`

- In the Third version, we do the same using `AWS` and `Azure` services of DevOps

- And iin the final one, in which we are going to use my own `Docker Hub` to store Docker images and use that in my deployments.

- This version, is the basic one of what we are actually going to do.

- Everything that a Developer pushes, that should go through this Pipeline and whether it is success or a failure, we are gonna notified via Mail using `SMTP` protocol that we do in Jenkins.

This is how the flow of our project looks.
